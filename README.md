# Dexteroid

This project here is only for demo purposes and part of Dexteroid source code. We plan to release the complete source code in future after fixing all minor issues and critical bugs, if any.

##1. Features

Dexteroid is a static analysis tool which uses reverse-engineered life cycle models to accurately capture the behaviors of Android components. It systematically derives event sequences from the models, and uses them to detect attacks launched by specific ordering of events. A prototype implementation of Dexteroid detects two types of attacks: (1) leakage of private information, and (2) sending SMS to premium-rate numbers. To validate effectiveness of the framework, a series of experiments are conducted on 1526 Google Play apps, 1259 Genome Malware apps, and a suite of benchmark apps called DroidBench. Our evaluation results show that the proposed framework is effective and efficient in terms of precision, recall, and execution time.
